marco-minimal
=============

Owing to the fact that the MarcoPolo reference implementation is written in Python, it seemed a burden to include the Python interpreter and its dependencies inside the minimal OS image. marco-minimal is a C/C++ implementation of a subset of the Marco functionality that has no dependencies (other than the standard C and C++ libraries) and thus it can run on an environment with no Python interpreter or very few typical libraries.

The most notable difference is the absence of a bindable local Marco instance. In order to reduce the overload, the executable multicasts the Marco commands itself, without requesting a centralized daemon to do the work. This is ideal for the kind of environment the library is built for.

The API is kept intact, except for some optional parameters that have not been included. The :ref:`reference <marcominimalreference>` covers the technical details of the implementation.

The API can be included in the compiled files or linked as a static or dynamic library.
